# ProjectCool_v1.0
Standalone add-on for any personal computer, which allows you to control 3-pin (4-pin in future) case and CPU fans autonomously or via desktop monitoring app

This system is ATMega328p-based product, which allows you to control any 3-pin and even 4-pin case fans and any of ARGB devices, depending on the temperatures inside case and tweak all the settings though the desktop app

Here you can find latest system firmwares with latest fixes. For desktop app, please visit here (https://github.com/SonikPr/ProjectCool_Edgerunners_edition_2.2) for actual supported version or here (https://github.com/SonikPr/ProjectCool_NT) for version under development.
NOTE UNDER DEVELOPMENT doesent work yet, because it applies different data gathering methods and packet xyntax, so, dont think that it will work.
